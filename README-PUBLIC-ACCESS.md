# Public Access Configuration for Development

## Important Security Notice

This application has been configured with **public access** settings for development purposes only. The current configuration:

1. Bypasses authentication checks in Firebase mock services
2. Uses a default public user ID when no user is authenticated
3. Sets Firebase security rules to allow global read/write access

## Implementation Details

The following changes have been made to allow public access:

1. **Firestore Access**: The `getCurrentUserId()` function in `firebase/firestore.ts` has been modified to return a default user ID (`'default-public-user'`) when no user is authenticated.

2. **Storage Access**: Similarly, the `getCurrentUserId()` function in `firebase/storage.ts` has been updated to allow unauthenticated access.

3. **Security Rules**: The Firebase security rules in `firebase/security-rules.txt` have been updated to allow global read/write access for all collections and storage paths.

4. **Record Access**: Authentication checks have been removed from the following functions:
   - `getAnimalRecordById()`
   - `updateAnimalRecord()`
   - `deleteAnimalRecord()`

## Warning for Production

**DO NOT USE THESE SETTINGS IN PRODUCTION!**

These changes are meant for development and testing purposes only. Before deploying to production:

1. Restore proper authentication checks
2. Update security rules to enforce user-based access control
3. Implement proper error handling for unauthenticated requests

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with data access, check that:

1. The mock implementation is being used correctly
2. The default user ID is properly recognized across the application
3. API calls are formatted correctly for the modified functions

For any authentication-related errors, verify that the authentication bypass is functioning correctly by checking console logs for "No authenticated user, using default user ID" messages.
